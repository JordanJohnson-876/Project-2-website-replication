        <div><h1>Benefits of Honey</h1></div>
        <div class="row" style="margin-left:30px;">
                <div>
                    <h2>Rich in Antioxidants</h2>
                    <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a 
                        natural sugar subtitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But 
                        specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised
                        throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Improves Cholesterol</h2>
                    <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) Cholesterol
                        by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%. Honey may
                        also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h2>Natural Cough Medicine</h2>
                    <p>Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study
                        , it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications throat
                        contain dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppressant. You can create
                        your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with
                        herbal tea or warm water and lemon.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Improves Heart health</h2>
                    <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, which may
                        support better health. Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants
                        could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk
                        for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm
                        those findings.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Lower Blood Pressure</h2>
                    <p>Blood pressure is an improtant risk factor for heart disease, and honey
                        may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that
                        have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans
                        have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Antibacterial Properties</h2>
                    <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its 
                        antibacterial properties. it also has a high sugar content, which can help
                        stop the growth of certain bacteria. Additionally, honey has a low pH level.
                        This works to pull moisture away from bacteria,causing the bacteria to get
                        dehydrated and die off.
